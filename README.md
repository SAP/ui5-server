## Server
The UI5 Build and Development Tooling comes along with a web server component to serve a project.

### Middlewares

The development server has already a set of middlewares which supports the developer with the following features:

* Translation files with `.properties` extension are properly encoded with **ISO-8859-1**.
* Changes on files with `.less` extension triggers a theme build and delivers the compiled CSS files.
* Version info is created automatically (`/resources/sap-ui-version.json`).
* List project files with URL (needed exclusively by the OpenUI5 testsuite): `/discovery/app_pages`, `/discovery/all_libs`, `/discovery/all_tests`

## Certificates for HTTPS or HTTP/2

`ui5 serve` will automatically use an SSL certificate for HTTPS and HTTP/2 servers.

Upon startup, it checks if a certificate exists within the path provided.
If there is none, a new certificate is created and used.


**Hint:** If Chrome unintentionally redirects a HTTP-URL to HTTPS, you need to delete the HSTS mapping in [chrome://net-internals/#hsts](chrome://net-internals/#hsts) by entering the domain name (e.g. localhost) and pressing "delete".
